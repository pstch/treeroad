models.py structure
---

First part, abstract models
Second part, real models

Each part is structured by "levels", counting from 0. Levels are ruled this way:
	- Models in the same level can not have relations between them (ForeignKeys)
	- Models in the a level can not have relations (ForeignKeys) to lower levels objects.
These rules are made in order to keep a consistenty and structure in the model structure. They may change, and it will be written here with an explaination.

For each model, there is a comment indicating the model requirements in admin.py.
For each model field, there is a comment indicating the model field requirements in the model admin definition in admin.py.
This should be pretty straightforward.
